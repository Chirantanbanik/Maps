# Maps

Description: A Maps web app which is used for searching different places & knowing the directions for reaching a destination from a starting point.
When you first visit the link it will ask you for Location access, allow it. After allowing it will show the place in the map where you currently stay.
In my case I study in Sikkim Manipal Institute of Technology so when I granted my location it showed this.
